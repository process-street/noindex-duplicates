== Description ==
This plugin is based on Fix-Duplicates plugin.

It's very useful mainly when you have users content included into your blog/site.

This plugin fixes duplicate content by adding a custom field that marks that post as 'noindex'. The oldest one of that duplicate group will not be marked so the search engines will be able to index it.
The plugin shows all the duplicates even if only two of them are 'noindexed'. When there is only one not indexed, the plugin doesn't show as duplicates.

In order to make use of this functionality, the code below has to be added to the functions.php file:

function apply_noindex_meta_tag(){

    $noindex = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), 'noindex', true );

    if ( (int) $noindex === 1 ) {
        echo '<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />' . "\n";
    }
}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'apply_noindex_meta_tag' );
